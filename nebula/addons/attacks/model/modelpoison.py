"""
This module provides a function for adding noise to a machine learning model's parameters, simulating
data poisoning attacks. The main function allows for the injection of various types of noise into
the model parameters, effectively altering them to test the model's robustness against malicious
manipulations.

Function:
- modelpoison: Modifies the parameters of a model by injecting noise according to a specified ratio
  and type of noise (e.g., Gaussian, salt, salt-and-pepper).

        Adds random noise to the parameters of a model for the purpose of data poisoning.

        This function modifies the model's parameters by injecting noise according to the specified
        noise type and ratio. Various types of noise can be applied, including salt noise, Gaussian
        noise, and salt-and-pepper noise.

        Args:
            model (OrderedDict): The model's parameters organized as an `OrderedDict`. Each key corresponds
                                 to a layer, and each value is a tensor representing the parameters of that layer.
            poisoned_ratio (float): The proportion of noise to apply, expressed as a fraction (0 <= poisoned_ratio <= 1).
            noise_type (str, optional): The type of noise to apply to the model parameters. Supported types are:
                                        - "salt": Applies salt noise, replacing random elements with 1.
                                        - "gaussian": Applies Gaussian-distributed additive noise.
                                        - "s&p": Applies salt-and-pepper noise, replacing random elements with either 1 or low_val.
                                        Default is "gaussian".

        Returns:
            OrderedDict: A new `OrderedDict` containing the model parameters with noise added.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If `poisoned_ratio` is not between 0 and 1, or if `noise_type` is unsupported.

        Notes:
            - If a layer's tensor is a single point (0-dimensional), it will be reshaped for processing.
            - Unsupported noise types will result in an error message, and the original tensor will be retained.
